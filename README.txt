# Authentication system for a banking system
This is my two-factor authentication system for a banking system for KIT214 assignment-1. I got 100% which is a HD for this assignment. 
My system has:
- Login Web page.
- Email sending page
- A Display Page that shows basic user information:
  - Name
  - Address
  - Balance
- A logout page showing â€˜Good Bye


Note: The link does not work anymore because the Nectar cloud server allocation expires after 6 months.
Link for login page: http://131.217.173.86/Assign1/index.php
